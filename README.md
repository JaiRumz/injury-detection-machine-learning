# Injury detection in vehicle crashes

A simple machine learning project where a person is classified as injured or not in a vehicle crash based on certain parameters.

Initially, I have cleaned the data, dropped some redundant columns and performed Exploratory Data Analysis. I have also shown some visualizations.

Three algorithms have been compared: Decision Tree, Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Dataset

I have used the [Chicago Traffic Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/) that is provided by the Chicago Data Portal.
